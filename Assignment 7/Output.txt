*  ASSIGNMENT #7 : Exceptions
*****************************************************

Using the code from assignment 6 write and test the assert macro (both
pass and fail) using two different executions. Then add a an exceptions to
the Square class that throws an exception if the length of a side is less
than 0 or greater than 50 feet.The program will output the values that
caused the exceptions (pass a value to the exception routine). The program
will allow one to recover from an invalid length (for example, change the
length of the side of the Square to a valid length).
